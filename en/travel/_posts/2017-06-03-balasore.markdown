## Panchalingeswar Temple

Panchalingeshwar Temple, Balasore, Odisha, India.

Panchalingeshwar Temple is in Balasore district of Odisha. It named after the five Shivalinga that are enshrined inside. The temple is on top of a hillock near the Nilagiri hill.

The Shivalingas are said to have been enshrined by Sita, the wife of Lord Rama during their exile. Another story holds that King Banasura worshiped the Swayambhu Lingas at this place given its beauty. A perennial stream, which is the main attraction of the area, regularly washes the Shivalingas as it flows over them. To reach to the temple one has to lie flat on the rock parallel to the stream to touch and worship the lingas inside the water stream.

Although this is in a nice natural place, but lingas seem to be artificial. Need major development work to make it more attractive tourist destination.

### How to reach: 
From Balasore by bus or rented car to travel 30km. Then walk 1km in hilly road and then to climb 263 stairs to reach the Temple.
