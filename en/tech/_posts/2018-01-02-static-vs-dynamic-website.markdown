In digital world everything is dynamic, it can be changed anything, anytime. But for website development, you need to understand the pros and cons before you decide, which form of website you want.

## Dynamic Website

### Pros
1. Dynamic Content Management

### Cons
1. Slower than Static (Loading time)
2. Expensive to Host
3. Extra work to Migrate
4. Need Database to maintain
5. Less control on Look and Feel
6. Lots of components to fail

## Static Website

### Pros
1. Faster compare to CMS
2. Hosting is less expensive
3. Easy to migrate (Just copy / paste)
4. Source controlled Code
5. Almost no component to fail
6. Easy to customize

### Cons
1. Need Extra effort to change content

Now, unless your content is changing multiple times daily or weekly, you should go for STATIC website. OR, you should start with Static website, if later you find inconvenience in regularly updating contents, then convert this static site to DYNAMIC!

Never address the problem what will happens after 10 years, address things which will happen in next 1 year. In digital parlance, a software become obsolete after 5 years, a website become obsolete after 2 years ... so don't think about 10 years down the line, solve immediate problem and when new problem will come you can solve them when it comes. As it is digital, you can change anytime!

Here is an example of this in real life:

Say, you are single person and you need an vehicle to office daily. Now you have given 2 options:
1. Buy Maruti 800, OR
2. Buy an Innova

If you are cost aware and just buying your first car, you may go for Maruti 800 or similar product. But if your are over thinking person, you can think that over the next 40 years, you will get married, will have children and grand children, so better buy an Innova, so that it can carry all your family members including grandchildren! Although you will provide extra fuel costs and maintenance for services for which you have no need at the moment, but may arise in future.

Now, it is upto you to decide, which path you need to follow.
